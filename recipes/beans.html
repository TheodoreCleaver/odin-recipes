    <h2>Great by themselves or a garnish!</h2>
    <p class="top">These pickled green beans turn out very crisp with a wonderful dill flavor, and the red pepper flakes provide a nice punch. This recipe is from my grandmother's cookbook that she passed on to all her grandchildren. It's much better than those that call for cooking the beans first.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>¼ cup salt</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>2 ½ pounds fresh green beans</li>
        <li>6 large sprigs dill</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Inspect six 1/2-pint jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.</li>
        <li>While the jars are bring sterilized, stir together vinegar, water, and salt in a large saucepan. Add garlic and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Trim green beans to 1/4-inch shorter than the jars.</li>
        <li>Remove jars from simmering water. Place 1 sprig of dill and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes in each jar. Pack in green beans standing on end.</li>
        <li>Ladle boiling brine (leave out garlic) into the jars, filling within 1/4-inch of the tops. Seal jars with lids and rings.
        </li>
        <li>Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a simmer (do not boil), cover, and process for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove jars from the stockpot and cool to room temperature, 8 to 12 hours. Test jars for a good seal by pressing on the center of the lid — it should not move.</li>
        <li>Let green beans ferment for 2 to 3 weeks in a cool, dark space before eating.</li>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> A dill head is the dill plant's 3- to 4-inch, umbrella-shaped seed head. If you can't find fresh dill heads, you may substitute 1 teaspoon dill seeds for 1 dill head.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong>If any jars do not seal properly, refrigerate and eat those beans within a week.</p>
